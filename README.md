# GitShout
A node.js server + windows tray app that notifies you of commits to your github repositories

GitShout is a simple notification app built on Node.js that allows you to stay on top of commits to your GitHub repository.

GitShout will open a balloon notification in your tray with a message "X has committed to Repostory Y: 'Fixed bug #336'".

Clicking on the balloon tip will open your default browser and take you directly to the summary of that commit on GitHub.
